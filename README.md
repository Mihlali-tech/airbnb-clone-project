ALX AirBnB Clone – backend &amp; frontend implementation
# AirBnB Clone Project
This is a clone of the AirBnB platform, built as part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum.
A comprehensive, real-world application simulating a robust booking platform like Airbnb.
Focuses on full-stack development with emphasis on:
Backend systems
Database design
API development
Application security
Teaches learners about complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics.
Builds a scalable web application using modern development practices.
Uses technologies like Django, MySQL, GraphQL, along with CI/CD tools such as Docker and GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Recreate the basic backend and frontend of AirBnB using a modular, scalable architecture
- Practice object-oriented programming and data persistence
- Implement a dynamic website with user interaction features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- Django  
- MySQL  
- HTML/CSS  
- JavaScript  
- GraphQL  
- Docker  
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  
- Unit testing (unittest module)


## 📁 Project Structure (to be added)

- `models/` – Python classes and database models
- `console.py` – Command-line interpreter
- `web_static/` – Frontend components

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!

## Updated Team Roles

This project simulates a full-stack team working collaboratively on a scalable web application. Below are the key roles and their responsibilities:

### 🔹 Backend Developer
Designs and implements server-side logic, RESTful APIs, and application workflows. Focuses on security, scalability, and integration with databases and frontend.

### 🔹 Frontend Developer
Creates user-facing interfaces and connects them with backend APIs. Ensures responsive design, accessibility, and user experience.

### 🔹 Database Administrator (DBA)
Plans and maintains the database schema. Manages data integrity, performance optimization, and security of stored information.

### 🔹 DevOps Engineer
Builds and manages CI/CD pipelines using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions. Handles deployment workflows, version control, and infrastructure automation.

### 🔹 QA Engineer
Writes and executes tests to ensure code reliability and quality. Detects bugs early and helps maintain production readiness.

### 🔹 Technical Writer / Documentation Lead
Maintains high-quality project documentation. Ensures clarity in README, database schema docs, API references, and team onboarding materials.

### 🔹 Project Manager
Coordinates team members, milestones, and delivery timelines. Keeps development aligned with project goals and ensures collaboration across roles.

## Technology Stack

### Django  
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application, providing tools to develop RESTful APIs, handle routing, and manage user authentication securely and efficiently.

### MySQL  
A relational database management system used to store and manage the application's data, such as user profiles, listings, bookings, and reviews.

### GraphQL  
An API query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving flexibility and performance compared to traditional REST APIs.

### Docker  
A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### GitHub Actions  
A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform integrated with GitHub to automate testing, building, and deployment pipelines for the application.

### HTML/CSS  
Technologies used to build and style the frontend user interface, ensuring the web pages are visually appealing and responsive.

### JavaScript  
A programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the frontend, enabling features such as client-side validation and asynchronous requests.

### Unit Testing (unittest module)  
Python’s built-in testing framework used to write and run tests to ensure that individual units of code work as expected and maintain code quality.
