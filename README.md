## Updated Team Roles

This project simulates a full-stack team working collaboratively on a scalable web application. Below are the key roles and their responsibilities:

### üîπ Backend Developer
Designs and implements server-side logic, RESTful APIs, and application workflows. Focuses on security, scalability, and integration with databases and frontend.

### üîπ Frontend Developer
Creates user-facing interfaces and connects them with backend APIs. Ensures responsive design, accessibility, and user experience.

### üîπ Database Administrator (DBA)
Plans and maintains the database schema. Manages data integrity, performance optimization, and security of stored information.

### üîπ DevOps Engineer
Builds and manages CI/CD pipelines using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions. Handles deployment workflows, version control, and infrastructure automation.

### üîπ QA Engineer
Writes and executes tests to ensure code reliability and quality. Detects bugs early and helps maintain production readiness.

### üîπ Technical Writer / Documentation Lead
Maintains high-quality project documentation. Ensures clarity in README, database schema docs, API references, and team onboarding materials.

### üîπ Project Manager
Coordinates team members, milestones, and delivery timelines. Keeps development aligned with project goals and ensures collaboration across roles.



## Technology Stack

### Django  
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application, providing tools to develop RESTful APIs, handle routing, and manage user authentication securely and efficiently.

### MySQL  
A relational database management system used to store and manage the application's data, such as user profiles, listings, bookings, and reviews.

### GraphQL  
An API query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving flexibility and performance compared to traditional REST APIs.

### Docker  
A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### GitHub Actions  
A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform integrated with GitHub to automate testing, building, and deployment pipelines for the application.

### HTML/CSS  
Technologies used to build and style the frontend user interface, ensuring the web pages are visually appealing and responsive.

### JavaScript  
A programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the frontend, enabling features such as client-side validation and asynchronous requests.

### Unit Testing (unittest module)  
Python‚Äôs built-in testing framework used to write and run tests to ensure that individual units of code work as expected and maintain code quality.



## Database Design

The database is designed to support the core functionalities of the Airbnb Clone platform. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

### Users  
- **Fields:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `phone_number`  
- **Description:** Represents the users of the platform, including hosts and guests. Users can list properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.

### Properties  
- **Fields:** `id`, `owner_id` (references Users), `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`  
- **Description:** Represents the rental properties listed by users (hosts). Each property is owned by one user but can have many bookings.

### Bookings  
- **Fields:** `id`, `user_id` (guest, references Users), `property_id` (references Properties), `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`  
- **Description:** Records a user‚Äôs reservation of a property for a specified time period. Each booking is linked to one property and one user.

### Reviews  
- **Fields:** `id`, `user_id` (author, references Users), `property_id` (references Properties), `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`  
- **Description:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed at.

### Payments  
- **Fields:** `id`, `booking_id` (references Bookings), `amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_method`, `status`  
- **Description:** Tracks payment transactions related to bookings, including amount paid and payment status.

---

### Relationships Overview

- **Users** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- Each **Property** can have many **Bookings**.  
- Each **Booking** is made by one **User** and is for one **Property**.  
- **Users** can leave multiple **Reviews**, each tied to a specific **Property**.  
- Each **Booking** has one corresponding **Payment** record.



 Feature Breakdown
Objective: Detail the features of the Airbnb Clone project.

Instructions:

-In your README.md file, create a section called ‚ÄúFeature Breakdown‚Äù.

List the main features (e.g., user management, property management, booking system, etc.) as outlined in the project overview.

Provide a 2-3 sentence description of each feature, explaining how it contributes to the project.

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.



## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure the integrity of the Airbnb Clone platform. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication  
Users must securely verify their identity before accessing protected resources. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users can interact with the system.

### Authorization  
After authentication, authorization controls what actions a user can perform based on their role (e.g., guest, host, admin). This protects sensitive operations like managing listings and processing payments.

### Rate Limiting  
To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, the API will enforce rate limiting. This limits the number of requests a client can make within a given timeframe, maintaining service availability and stability.

### Data Encryption  
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest to prevent data breaches.

### Input Validation and Sanitization  
All inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Why Security Matters:**

- Protecting **user data** (personal information, passwords) is essential for user privacy and regulatory compliance.  
- Securing **payments** prevents fraud and financial loss.  
- Preventing **unauthorized access** ensures only rightful users can modify their data and listings.  
- Maintaining **service availability** through rate limiting avoids downtime from malicious attacks.
